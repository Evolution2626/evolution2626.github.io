    <p>This year's challenge is complex. Teams can breach opponents' defenses to cross into the enemy's courtyard, from which they can throw boulders into goals to weaken the opponent's tower. Breaching 4 of the 5 defenses and capturing the enemy's tower is extremely advantageous. Teams must decide if they want to specialize in one section of the game or try to cover all facets.
